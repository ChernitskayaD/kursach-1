You find yourself in an unknown city. You are surrounded by
dull buildings and strangers.
Uncertainty frightens you. Filled with feeling of
missunderstanding, you, knowing nothing about how to exist
here, set off to find any answers. Suddenly, something 
touches your leg.
You, startled with suddenness, look down. A small, skinny
cat, as lost in this world as you, looks at you with  eyes
full of fear.
Something scares the cat off, and he runs away with no
turning around.
Realizing that it is the only creature that recognized your
presence, you ask yourself a question:
Should I run after him?
Press 1 to run after him.
Press 2 to go further.

The cat eventually got away from your sight.
You continue walking down the gloomy street.
You search alleys and prospects, seeking for something
familiar.
You try to find anyone who will pay attention to you.
Far away there is a silhoutte of THE running cat.
This time you have no doubt that you need to follow it.
Finally, you caught up with the cat.
The cat meows loudly and looks at the left.
You see a scary dark creature resembling a human. 
He falls on his knees in front you and streches his bony arm
towards you.
You understand that this human needs help, but his face
scares you off with its' ugliness. 
Should you give him a hand?
Press 1 to help.
Press 2 to ignore.

Suddenly, someone pushes you from the back.
You feel chilling cold and you realize that you're under the
water. 
Now you don't really have a choice. 
You need to rescue the girl.
You get sure that the girl is safe now.
Drenched and chilled from freezing water you set off in hope
to find any dry clothes. 
You are still following the mysterious cat.
All of a sudden, a car appeares from the corner.
It drives past quickly and to your horror follows the cat.
You understand that the cat won't survive this "encounter".
You need to decide fast whether you save the cat or submit 
to your fear.
Press 1 to save the cat.
Press 2 to stay away.

You close your eyes out of fear.
After few seconds you open you open your eyes and see an
evaporating haze and the car leaving the street.
You realize that this is not the real cat, it's just an 
illusion and you feel like this about everything un this
city.
You notice the cat walking near you.
Afar you see a column of streaming smoke, and, of course,
the cat heads in this direction.
Coming closer to the smoke, you understand that there is 
a fire.
You hear terrifying screams coming out of the burning
building.
Though the fire isn't that big, people are trapped and
can't see how to make thier way out.
However, you see the way out of the building free from the
flames.
You can help the people but the smoke will probably affect
your weak lungs.
There is a chance that you won't be able complete your 
journey.
Should you help the people?
Press 1 to help.
Press 2 to stay aside.
<9>
You hear a loud overwhelming sound.
You can't see nothing, you can't even open your eyes.
It is an exposion of the burning building.
You think you are dead, you feel that you are dead.
You can't move any of your limb.
Your ears catch the familiar meow.
You aren't dead but at this point you don't even feel slight
happiness from your survival.
"You journey is almost over. You need to make your last 
choice. I hope, you won't let me down", the mysterious voice 
filling all the space around almost deafens you.
"To escape this place you need to make a sacrifice and kill
the only kind spirit in this city".
You immediately understand that the voice is talking about
your small companion.
"You don't have any time left! You must choose now!",
echoing from all surfaces the loud voice reaches you.
What should you do?
Press 1 to save the cat.
Press 2 to kill the cat.
